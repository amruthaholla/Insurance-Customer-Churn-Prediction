# Insurance Customer Churn Prediction
This project uses a real-world insurance dataset to predict whether a customer will churn using various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and KNN.

## Objective
To identify the key factors that influence customer churn and build predictive models to assist retention strategy.

## Files
- `Predicting_Insurance_Customer_Churn.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with EDA, preprocessing, modeling, and performance evaluation
- `Auto Insurance Customer Churn Analysis.pdf`: Slide deck summarizing approach, findings, and business recommendations
- `churn_dataset.csv`: Dataset used for training and testing the models         

## Tools & Techniques
**Languages & Libraries:** 
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Techniques:**
- Data Cleaning & Imputation
- Feature Engineering & Transformation
- Classification Models: Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, KNN
- Ensemble Learning: Voting Classifier
- SMOTE (to address class imbalance)
- Cross-validation & Threshold Tuning

## How to Run
- Download the notebook file from this repository
- Open it in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
- Run all cells to explore the analysis and model results
